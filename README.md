# Tailwind CSS classes not being applied

This repository contains a bug report and solution for a common issue with Tailwind CSS where classes are not applied correctly despite proper configuration and imports. The bug is demonstrated in `bug.js` and the solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS classes in an HTML file. The classes are not rendered, resulting in unexpected styling. The problem is related to the way Tailwind CSS processes the HTML file.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `content` option in `tailwind.config.js` includes the correct paths to HTML files. The provided solution ensures all the necessary paths to scan are included to ensure the correct identification and application of Tailwind CSS classes. This fixes the issue and allows the classes to be applied and rendered appropriately.  This solution also updates `index.html` to use the locally installed Tailwind CSS, removing the CDN reference. This is a best practice and ensures proper version management.
